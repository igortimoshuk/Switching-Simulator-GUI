This was a program I used as part of my graduate research. The program was originally written in C# using Visual Studio and included heavy integration with Matlab.

The key file and fucntions in the program are

 - Magnetic_Parameters.cs
 - MersenneTwister.cs
 - Magnetic_Simulator_Demag.cs
   - Energy
   - Noise
     - Normal_Distribution
   - RK42
     - D_Phi2
     - D_Theta2
   - Coord_Correction

The rest of the program is effectively there to plot results via Matlab.
